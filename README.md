# RL-Stat-Bracket

## Why I made this app
My friends and I love to play rocket league together, we even have a clan to keep things organized.
We also loved doing tournaments with fellow clanmates. However, it's incredibly difficult to keep
track of all the standings when the only applications you have at your disposal are Google sheets or
Microsoft Excel.
